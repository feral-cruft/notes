e.g. when the file at  
https://github.com/cruft-ninja/feral-jupyter/blob/master/reading-list.ipynb  
is viewed at  
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cruft-ninja/feral-jupyter/blob/master/reading-list.ipynb  
a cached version of the file is shown sometimes  
it can be fixed it by adding ?flush_cache=true at the end of the url  
https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cruft-ninja/feral-jupyter/blob/master/reading-list.ipynb?flush_cache=true
